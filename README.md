## What's the point?
* Practice making code more accessible
* Practice refacotring code by reducing lines of code and increasing readibility

## What was the issue?
The initial source code was not accessible and had a lot of repeated code. In other words, let's make this thing more DRY!

## Lessons Learned
After going through and refactoring the source code, it's easier to be more mindful of tagging and naming them the first go around.

## Notes
Not necessarily an accessibilty master just yet, but practice makes perfect!...or something close to that üèÜ)
